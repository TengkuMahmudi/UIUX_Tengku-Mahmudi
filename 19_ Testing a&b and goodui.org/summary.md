### Why should you consider A/B test ?
- Why ?
    - Solve visitor point
	- Get better ROI fOR existing traffic
	- Reduce rebounce rate
	- Redesign website to increase future bussiness gain
	- Achieve statistically significant improvements
	- Make low-risk modifications
	
### What can you A/B test ?
- Explanation
	- Copy , headbody and subheadline , body, subject lines
	- Navigation , match visituor expectations, make your website's navigaion predictable , creating a fluid easy-to-naviga website
	- Design and layourt, provide clear information highlight costumers review, write simple content , create a sense of urgency
	- Froms
	- CTA (call -to- acation)
	- different depth
	- Social Proof
	
### Different types aof A/B tests
- multiple testing
- Pages of Split URL testing
- Multivariate testing (MVT)

### A/B Testing statistical approach
- Comaprison
	- A. Frequentis approach
	- Frequentist statistic follow the probability as long term frequency definition of probability
	- in this approach, you can only use data from your current experiment. the frequentist solution is to conduct test and draw conclusions
	- Give an extimated mean( and standard deviating) of samples where A beats B but completely ignores the cases when B beats A
	- Requires the test to run for a set period to get correct data from it but can't figure out how close or far A and B actually are. it fails to tell you the probability of A beating B
	- B. Bayesian Approach
	- Bayesian statistics follow the nations of Probability as degree of belief and logical probability
	- in this approach , you use your prior knowledge from the previous experiments and try yo incorporate that information into your current data, the bayesian solution is to use existing data to draw conclusions
	- it takes into account the possibility if A beating B and also calculates the range of the improvement you can expect
	- Gives you more control over testing. You can now plan better , have a more accurate reason to end test and get into the nitty-gritty of how close or far apart A and B are

### How to perform an A/B test ?
- Steps , Research > Observe and formulate hypothesis > create variations > run test > analyse result and deploy changes

### A/B Testing Examples
- Some examples , one column , give a gift ,social proof , repetition , distinct clicable/selected styles , recommendi

## Kesimpulan , ikuti setiap langkah yang terlibat dengan rajin dan waspadai semua kesalahan besar dan kecil yang dapat Anda lakukan jika Anda tidak memberikan data pentingnya yang layak. Pengujian A/B sangat berharga untuk meningkatkan tingkat konversi situs web Anda.
